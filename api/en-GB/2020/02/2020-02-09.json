{"title":"Roll out the red carpet","caption":"Hollywood's big night","desc":"It's Oscars night in Tinseltown, so take a moment to gaze over Los Angeles with an unfamiliar view of a famous US landmark. The Hollywood Sign originally read 'Hollywoodland' when it was erected in 1923 and was festooned with light bulbs to advertise a property development. But within a few years, as the silent-film era gave way to 'talkies', the sign evolved into a popular tourist attraction. Falling into disrepair in ensuing decades (at the peak of its decay, the sign was missing its third 'O' altogether) the original was demolished and a sturdier version built in 1978.","copyright":"The Hollywood sign overlooking Los Angeles, California, USA (© Sean Pavone/Shutterstock)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=hollywood+sign&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200209_0000%22","date":"20200209","image":{"name":"OHR.HollywoodSign_EN-GB2646976442.jpg","hd":"/images/276D3FE6B9EE92A3A9A2B7D701A118B41D4E4D4C539310B204D46D1C36F2952A.jpg","tmb":"/images/6C6C1C74337F0C89738B74D89E2A5E42419217DE1B2D0F427BF9B2A62E195DD7.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HollywoodSign_EN-GB2646976442_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.HollywoodSign_EN-GB2646976442_tmb.jpg"}}
