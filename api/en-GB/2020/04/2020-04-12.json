{"title":"Floating temples","caption":"Thailand's floating temples","desc":"Greetings from the mountain peaks of northern Thailand, near the city of Lampang, where these golden and white 'floating' stupas and pagodas have majestically transformed the landscape. Constructing them was a massive effort, with materials hauled up in pieces by around 50 workers under the direction of a Lampang monk over two years. The resulting temple complex of Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Phrachomklao Rachanusorn is off the beaten path, but enjoys spectacular views from the top.
