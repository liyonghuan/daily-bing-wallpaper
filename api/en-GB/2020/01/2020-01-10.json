Founded on 10 January 1920, after World War One, it served as an international diplomatic organisation until World War Two, when it gradually lost support and was eventually replaced by the United Nations. The Palace, built to be the League of Nation’s headquarters, has served as UN headquarters in Geneva and hosts diplomats for thousands of meetings every year.","copyright":"Flags outside the UN's Palace of Nations in Geneva, Switzerland (© Mustafa Yalcin/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=palace+of+nations+in+geneva+switzerland&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200110_0000%22","date":"20200110","image":{"name":"OHR.LeagueNations_EN-GB8070390153.jpg","hd":"/images/70A0B73B30ED3508DB7BA70F28417B002EF087D3503849724F0545E636502761.jpg","tmb":"/images/20D07CAA75E4E32F27FB5FAB25BE670AAE7F80240A8CB889C23878809EC318A0.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeagueNations_EN-GB8070390153_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.LeagueNations_EN-GB8070390153_tmb.jpg"}}
