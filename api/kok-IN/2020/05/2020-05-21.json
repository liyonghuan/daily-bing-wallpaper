Just outside Meiringen, Switzerland, the Reichenbach Falls are the backdrop for 'The Final Problem'—the 1893 Sherlock Holmes story where, on a precipice near the falls (which in the 19th century gushed with far more power than our recent image shows), the genius detective enters a death duel with the criminal Professor Moriarty. In the end, both men plummet to their presumable doom.","copyright":"Reichenbach Falls, Bernese Oberland, Switzerland (© Chris Milne/Alamy)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=reichenbach+falls&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200521_1830%22","date":"20200521","image":{"name":"OHR.ReichenbachFalls_EN-IN5733199746.jpg","hd":"/images/A4C8C451D73101AB13BF1B8B995954F7222E6B62C132DA8D8B812417435C58E8.jpg","tmb":"/images/C116C947049CBBFF2F2A57BB7E2D0557ADFB512C008E65A1AB40977CF5E1649E.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReichenbachFalls_EN-IN5733199746_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.ReichenbachFalls_EN-IN5733199746_tmb.jpg"}}
