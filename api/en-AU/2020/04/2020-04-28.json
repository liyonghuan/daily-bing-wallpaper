{"title":"Exploring the Palouse","caption":"Exploring the Palouse","desc":"The Palouse region of America’s inland Pacific Northwest is an unusually hilly prairie that straddles the state line between the US states of Washington and Idaho. Farming seems an unlikely endeavour here, but the soil and weather patterns make it ideal for growing certain crops, especially wheat and lentils. This time of year, when the wheat and barley crops are young, the hills brighten to fresh shades of green.","copyright":"A tractor kicks up dust while tilling fields on the Palouse near Pullman, Washington (© Ben Herndon/Tandem Stills + Motion)","copyrightlink":"/search?q=the+palouse&form=hpcapt&filters=HpDate%3a%2220200428_1400%22","date":"20200428","image":{"name":"OHR.PalouseSpring_EN-AU0391821261.jpg","hd":"/images/9C52FB7C7759DFAF4387D29AED64BE0DD6D43B423D83616CD0CD72118DCAD795.jpg","tmb":"/images/14CD2E497035CB2E9A7119356F41D498BFFE4659DD4316CD0480724D4E06AA31.jpg","binghd":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PalouseSpring_EN-AU0391821261_1920x1080.jpg&rf=LaDigue_1920x1080.jpg&pid=hp","bingtmb":"https://www.bing.com/th?id=OHR.PalouseSpring_EN-AU0391821261_tmb.jpg"}}
